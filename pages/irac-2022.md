We cordially invite you to the **3rd International Radar Aeroecology Conference (IRAC 2022)** in Davos, Switzerland. The conference takes place on 25-26 June 2022, directly before the [World Biodiversity Forum](https://www.worldbiodiversityforum.org/). We look forward to welcoming many of you in person in Davos, but we will also offer online participation and make special arrangements for online participants presenting from different time zones. The conference will be a full 2-day event with plenary presentations, a poster session, and possibilities for informal discussions and networking.

Davos is a picturesque town in eastern Switzerland, the highest town in Europe at 1560m asl, and can easily be reached from Switzerland’s major cities and airports, by rail or road.

Davos offers unique and varied facilities for sport and leisure, both in summer and winter, renowned museums and galleries, and exceptional restaurants and shopping opportunities. Ninety hotels and more than a thousand holiday flats offer accommodation for everybody's taste, requirements and budget.

See the [World Biodiversity Forum page](https://www.worldbiodiversityforum.org/en/davos) for more information  on Davos, how to get there, accommodation, the environment and things to do in and around town.

We acknowledge that in pandemic times travel planning might be difficult. We will update COVID-19 regulations on site and for travelling to Switzerland closer to the conference.
